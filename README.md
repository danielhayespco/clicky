# clicky

This was our classes first React homework.

Clicky is a memory game built with React. The goal is to click all 11 images without clicking
one twice. If an image is clicked twice, the user recieves a "losing" message. If the user 
clicks all 11, they get a "winning" message. After each pick the images are mixed inorder to 
make it more difficult.
